What is a ranking? what is the basis for ranking?
A ranking is a based on a number of races and the placing of those places. Placings are
given a point value and then grouped by the greyhoundRef or greyhound parent ref.
Given a set of races. To determine a placings point value you need the placing and the
point table. but to get the point table to need to filter it based on criteria of the race.
So for example point value

Point scale
name: Group 1 Sprint
[
{placing:1,points:70},
{placing:2,points:60}
]
race criterias[{
from
to
groupLevel: g1
distanceMeters: less then 715
pointScaleRef: g1sprint
},
{
from
to
groupLevel: g2
distanceMeters: less then 715
pointScale: g2sprint
}]

groupLevel: 1
distanceMeters: less then 715
placing: 1
points: 70
